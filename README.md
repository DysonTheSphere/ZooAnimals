# ZooAnimals
 
**Team Names: Daniel, Nicole**

**Assumptions made for development**
- We assumed that different types of animals (cats vs lions vs dogs, etc) eat different things, and that different classes of animals (felines vs canines etc) roam in different places.
- Issues include learning Java
